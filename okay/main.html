                <h2>We spent the duration of our project to working on coding different fractals. <br/>
                    Some of it proved easier than we thought, but the majority of it was much more difficult <br/>
                    (There were a lot of failed tries, but somehow we ended up with a sub par final result)

                The most famous fractal is the <a href="new_try.html">Mandelbrot set</a>.<br/>
                The <a href="fractal%20tree%202.html">fractal tree</a> is also an interesting representation of repeating patterns in nature.<br/>
                This <a href="Page_02.html">fractal tree</a> was actually a mistake and is generated without the branching pattern so it looks kind of like a fern leaf.
                This fractal is called <a href="KochCurve.html">the Koch Curve</a> and has been said to resemble a snowflake. We have generated just a piece of it since it is easy to see the repeating patterns.<br/>
                (Don't worry if it takes like five minutes to load all of the loops in the code take quite a while to run.)

                The next phase of our project was taking simple shapes and turning them into repeating fractals.
            </h3>
            <p>
                This <a href="curves.html">fractal</a> uses circles inside one another.<br/>
                This <a href="circles2.html">fractal</a> also uses circles, but each repetition is translated to the right and left along the x-axis.<br/>
                Our <a href="circles3.html">third circle fractal</a> translated repeating circles along the y as well as the x axis.<br/>
                Since it was a little difficult to see the circles in the former fractal, we changed the conditions in the code to generate <a href="circles4.html">this fractal</a>.<br/>
                Here was another <a href="boxes.html">original curve</a>, however it does not have the characteristic repetition so would not be considered a fractal.<br/>
